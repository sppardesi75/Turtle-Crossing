# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

## 📌 Project Overview
**Turtle Crossing** is a Python-based arcade game inspired by the classic "Frogger." The player controls a turtle attempting to cross a busy road filled with moving cars. The goal is to reach the other side without getting hit.

This project was developed as a Capstone implementation to demonstrate proficiency in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, game logic, and Python's Turtle graphics library.

## 🎮 Game Rules
* **Objective:** Help the turtle cross the road to reach the top edge of the screen.
* **Levels:** Every time you reach the finish line, the level increases and the cars move faster.
* **Game Over:** If a car hits the turtle, the game ends immediately.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Player Control:** Smooth movement using the `Up` arrow key.
* **Dynamic Difficulty:** Car speed increases with every successful crossing.
* **Randomized Traffic:** Cars are generated with random colors and vertical positions to ensure every run is unique.
* **Score Tracking:** A scoreboard displays the current level in real-time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python 3.13
* **Library:** Turtle (Standard GUI library)
* **Concepts:** Inheritance, Event Listeners, Class Interaction
